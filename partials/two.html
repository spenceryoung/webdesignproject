            AngularJS is an MVC (Model View Controller) JavaScript framework. It holds the concept of single page web applications by updating views instead of preforming a full browser refresh. As one might guess, this concept significantly increases performance and decreases repetition of HTML elements.

            Angular's routing functionality is a great solution for creating single page applications such as this one. When the user clicks on a link it appears to go to another page. What's really happening is Angular updates the view by swapping out the page's content. In the case of this website, the content is everything except the navigation and footer.
