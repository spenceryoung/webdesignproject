            AngularJS is an MVC (Model View Controller) JavaScript framework. It holds the concept of single page web applications by updating views instead of preforming a full browser refresh. As one might guess, this concept significantly increases performance and decreases repetition of HTML elements.

            Angular's routing functionality is a great solution for creating single page applications such as this one. When the user clicks on a link it appears to go to another page. What's really happening is Angular updates the view by swapping out the page's content.

            For instance, when the home link is clicked on, Angular takes the content
            of partials/one.html and plugs it into the DOM. The scope of Angular's routing
            is determined by where <span class="aqua">ng-view</span> is placed in the HTML.
